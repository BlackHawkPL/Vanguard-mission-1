NEWTAB("1. SITUATION: CIVILIAN")
	<br/>1.a.) Civilian: Local civilians are under a curfew. However, increasing discontent among the civlian population has limited the curfew's effectiveness. Friendly UAVs have spotted a few civilian vehicles driving at night.
	<br/>
	<br/>1.b.) Enemy Overview: The 101st Mechanized Infantry Battalion is currently maintaining a defensive posture to the north of the international boundary. Their forces are currently occupying defensive positions on OBJ RIFLES (AR CO), OBJ Pistol (IN PLT). They have an armor recon PLT (+) advancing towards Key Terrain 1, 2, & 3 on OBJ Shotgun. This enemy force on OBJ Shotgun is the focus for the remainder of this OPORD.
	<br/>
	<br/>1.b.1.) Composition: Enemy forces on OBJ Shotgun consist of armored recon platoon (+) with Soviet style small arms and equipment (AK-47, RPG-7, PKM, NVG). They also have the following combat equipment:
	<br/>
	<br/>          3 x BMP-3
	<br/>          2 x T-72
	<br/>          1 x 60mm Mortar Section (2 x Gun Tubes)
	<br/>          2 x Helicopters (KA-52)
	<br/>          3 x Iglas
	<br/>
	<br/>1.b.2.) Disposition: Enemy forces are advancing towards OBJ Shotgun. Their exact direction of travel is unknown but likely North-to-South in order to seize key terrain as quickly as possible.
	<br/>
	<br/>1.b.3.) Enemy MLCOA: Enemy forces will seize key pieces of terrain and establish hasty defensive battle positions in vicinity of K1, K2, K3. Once established, they will use direct and indirect fires to destroy our forces.
	<br/>
	<br/>1.b.4.) Enemy MDCOA: Simliar to the above scenario, but instead of maintaining stand-off distance, the enemy will leave absolute minimum forces on key terrain in order to conduct a counter-attack to destroy our forces.

	<br/>
	<br/>1.c.1.) BN Mission: 0630 1-18 IN attacks to seize OBJ Pistol in order to secure the town of Charkia and enable freedom of maneuver to follow-on Brigade forces.
	<br/>
	<br/>1.c.2.) Concept of Battalion Operation: The decisive point of this shaping operation is the establishment of Company-sized SBF VIC OBJ Rifles. The Battalion will accomplish this by the BN Scouts conducting a Zone Recon from AA Ghost to the DZM. Once the zone recon is complete with enemy ATGM assets destroyed in sector, Dog Company will assault OBJ Rifles with Chaos Company conducting a follow and assume mission to establish a SBF on OBJ Rifles oriented north. The successful establishment of this SBF will enable freedom of maneuver for both Attack and Barbaric Company to assault and secure OBJ Pistol (Town of Charkia).
	<br/>
	<br/>1.c.3.) Adjacent Units: Battalion Scouts (Ghost Platoon) are already occupying AA Ghost in sector approx. 1km North of BN AA. Battalion Mortars joined Ghost Platoon. Brigade Air-Defense-Artillery (ADA) has also joined Ghost Platoon. All other Battalion forces are at AA Vanguard. Brigade Rotary Attack assets are currently operating in sector and will have limited capabilities to support our Battalionâ€™s maneuver.\
