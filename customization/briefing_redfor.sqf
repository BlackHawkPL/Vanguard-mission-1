NEWTAB("1.b. SITUATION: ENEMY")
	1.b. Enemy Overview: The enemy Combined Arms Battalion Battalion (CAB) is currently maintaining a defensive posture to the South of the international boundary. Their forces are currently occupying defensive positions around their main Forward Operating Base. They have an armor recon PLT (+) advancing towards Key Terrain 1, 2 and 3 on OBJ Boris. This enemy force on OBJ Boris is the focus for the remainder of this OPORD.
	<br/>
	<br/>1.b.1. Composition: Enemy forces advancing towards OBJ Boris consist of armored recon platoon (+) with American style small arms and equipment (M-4, M249, M240, NVG). They also have the following combat equipment:
	<br/>3 x M3A3
	<br/>5 x M1151 HMMWV
	<br/>1 x 60mm Mortar Section (2 x Gun Tubes)
	<br/>2 x Helicopters (AH-6)
	<br/>3 x Stinger ADA Systems

	<br/>
	<br/>1.b.2. Disposition: Enemy forces are advancing towards OBJ Boris. Their exact direction of travel is unknown but likely South-to-North in order to seize key terrain as quickly as possible.
	<br/>
	<br/>1b.3. Enemy Most Likely Course of Action: Enemy forces will seize key pieces of terrain and establish hasty defensive battle positions in vicinity of K1, K2, K3. Once established, they will use direct and indirect fires to destroy our forces.
	<br/>
	<br/>1.b.4 Enemy Most Dangerous Course of Action: Similar to above scenario but instead of maintaining stand-off distance, the enemy will leave absolute minimum forces on key terrain in order to conduct a counter-attack to destroy our forces.
